For the best experience, please view this page on a computer.

### Visualization modes

You can select different visualization modes using the tab bar:

Each mode offers a different type of orbital to visualize.

* "Real (Simple)" provides a selection of common atomic orbitals for quick access.
* "Real (Full)" allows arbitrary quantum numbers (up to *n* = 8) to be specified.
* "Complex" displays the complex orbitals, which are useful in certain contexts.
* "Hybrid" provides visualizations for hybridized orbitals and their symmetry.

### Help for specific features

Text with <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted; -webkit-text-decoration-style: dotted;">dotted underlines</span> have explanations. Hover over them with your cursor to read them.

### Interacting with visualizations

For 3D visualizations, you can:

* Left-click and drag to rotate
* Right-click and drag to pan
* Scroll to zoom

Additional options are available in the toolbar that appears when you hover over a plot. For example, you can use the "camera" tool to save a screenshot of the plot.
