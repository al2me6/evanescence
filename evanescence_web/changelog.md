# Version History

## 0.3.6, 2020-02-04

### Features

* Hover tooltips containing explanations for configuration options are now displayed.

### Known Issues

* Tooltips may be cut off by the screen edge on certain screen geometries.

## 0.3.5, 2020-02-02

### Features

* Presets for common quantum number sets. The full quantum number selector can be enabled by selecting "Custom" from the preset dropdown.
* Display the corresponding subshell and orbital names in dropdown menus, if applicable and possible.

## 0.3.4, 2021-01-28

### Features

* Blobs! Initial implementation of 3D isosurface plots.
* Add favicon and `meta` description tags.

### Changes

* Allow pan and zoom for radial plots.

### Known Issues

* The viewport for supplemental visualizations sometimes resets mysteriously.
* Isosurface cutoffs are in need of fine-tuning.

## 0.3.3, 2021-01-24

### Bugfixes

* Remove extraneous hover highlighting on cross-section indicators.

## 0.3.2, 2021-01-24

### Features

* A contour line is always placed at zero on cross-section plots. i.e., the nodes are always highlighted.

### Changes

* Values near zero are now shown in white instead of yellow on cross-section plots.

## 0.3.1, 2021-01-23

### Bugfixes

* Correctly remove the cross-section indicator from the main plot when the cross-section is turned off.

## 0.3.0, 2021-01-23

### Features

* Implement cross-sectional views. This visualization plots the xy-, yz-, or xz-plane cross section of a wavefunction as a 3D contour, clarifying the features of the orbital on that specific plane. An indicator is drawn on the pointillist visualization to show the plane on which the cross-section is taken.

## 0.2.1, 2021-01-23

### Bugfixes

* Fix display of negative numbers in dropdown menus. This is a regression introduced in v0.2.0.

## 0.2.0, 2021-01-22

### Features

* Initial implementation of supplemental visualizations. The first batch includes three radial plots: The radial wavefunction `R`, the radial probability `R^2`, and the radial probability distribution `r^2 R^2`.

### Bugfixes

* Mitigate artifacting on orbitals with `l` = 4, `m` = Â±4.
* Display quality names in sentence case.
* Always sample the origin in nodal surface plots. This improves the accuracy of certain features.

## 0.1.1, 2021-01-21

### Changes

* Improve dark theme appearance.
* Switch to Lato 2.0 font, hosted by Adobe Fonts.

## 0.1.0, 2021-01-21

### Features

* Improve orbital information panel, including giving the number of radial and angular nodes.

## 0.0.5, 2021-01-20

### Features

* Dark mode and page styling.
* Additional compilation flags for release builds.

## 0.0.4, 2021-01-19

### Features

* Third implementation of pointillist plot trace management. This brings significant speed improvements when switching quantum numbers or quality with nodal surfaces shown, by reducing the number of API calls and trace deletions/additions.

### Changes

* Reduce default quality from Medium to Low, raising the point size slightly to compensate.

## 0.0.3, 2021-01-18

### Features

* Compute radial and angular nodes separately. This allows the kind(s) of nodes being plotted to be selected, while also reducing the number of artifacts by reducing the number of intersections plotted by the same trace.
  * The management of traces in the pointillist plot is revamped to enable this functionality.

### Bugfixes

* Set the plot range and aspect ratio of plots at all times to eliminate jumps resulting from automatic plot range determination.

## 0.0.2, 2021-01-17

### Features

* (Rudimentary) plotting of nodal surfaces.
* Internal improvements to state handling.

## 0.0.1, 2021-01-16

### Features

* Initial implementation of the pointillist visualization, including the selection of quantum numbers and quality presets.
* Set up continuous integration for automatic deployment of the website.
