# Project Evanescence

*An exploration in the visualization of hydrogenic orbitals.*

</div>

The web interface is hosted [here](https://al2me6.github.io/evanescence).

Continuous benchmarks can be viewed [here](https://al2me6.github.io/evanescence/dev/bench).

## Features

This project is a work-in-progress. Currently, the following features are implemented:

* Computation of arbitrary real and complex hydrogen orbitals (up to *n* = 12 exposed)
* Computation of arbitrary linear combinations of real orbitals (a common selection exposed)
* A variant of the "pointillist" visualization presented in [Tully et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed300393s)
* Plotting of nodal surfaces
* Plotting of wavefunction cross-sections
* Plotting of radial wavefunction and probability density values
* Plotting of 3D isosurfaces
